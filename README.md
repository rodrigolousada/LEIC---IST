# 🎓 BSc in Computer Science and Engineering projects @ Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon

Projects made for subjects in my Bachelor of Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa. These projects were created to fulfill the requirements of various courses throughout my academic journey.

The goal of this repository is to report my projects either for me or other students to consult. These projects are not maintained and the goal is just for me to have it organized and public to share with the community.

**Note:** The Bachelor's program was mostly conducted in Portuguese, so some content may not be translated. I am available to clarify any doubts.
